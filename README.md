__Near boss’s chambers. Angel’s POV__

As the game offers two kind of characters, the game has two settings: one for Angels point of view, the other is for Demon POV.  

Let's assume that the player has chosen the Angel's POV. 

Angel's POV is about going down to the Hell. Illustrations for the level has transitions from Heaven to Hell: clouds, mountains, plains, caves, dungeons and boss chambers as a last level.

The game starts from the Heaven gates. 

The last cordon has been breached and dire destiny awaits the Heaven. The player has to, first of all, defend the gates and, if successful, will be allowed to proceed to the next location. With each successful defend, player will move to the Hell and boss's chambers.

Stronger enemies will appear as the Player wins battles. To deal with them Player is provided with the armory. Player has to choose and plan carefully about what to purchase and when to upgrade his weapons. 

For the sake of player, it is possible to purchase different attack strategies for the weapon.

It may happen that the Player faces defeat. Yet worry not, o brave soul! The Player was granted precious gems which will help him during such times! From the beginning, there are several gems in Player’s disposal. Manage them wisely.

## Gameplay

The Player is provided with the battlefield (later level, map) and the predefined start-point. In Player’s disposal are a several hundred coins, dozen precious gems and dozen health. The level is split in dozen of waves, which Player has to fend off to be able to proceed next.

To be able to interact with game world, Player has the ability to use weapons on the map. There is a predefined weaponry available. Tower is a 
materialization of weapon in the Divine Defense.

To build a tower, Player has to spend coins. 

Player cannot build a tower if there are not enough coins for one: either defeat enemies with current arsenal (refers to “Enemy defeat reward”), or wait for the next wave (refers to “Next wave bonus”). 

Each undefeated enemy will damage the Player: decrease Player’s health.

To defeat stronger enemies, Player can upgrade Towers. Player can upgrade Tower if there are enough coins for one.

If Player decides the Tower is not efficient for the current wave, it can be sold and removed from the map. In such case, the Player receives refund for the tower, minus fee.

By clearing all waves in level, the Player can proceed to the next level. Later, the Player can access newly achieved level at will.

If the Player is not successful - Player’s health drops to zero - he will be provided with 2 opportunities: restart the level or continue the wave with “blessing”. Blessings are in several options: continue with full health restored or continue with several restored health.

The game is considered finished when the Player clears last level.
