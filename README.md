**Game idea**: There are two eternal fractions, battling over and over.
Choose your fraction and join the divine battle for world domination!

You may choose between Demon and Angel fraction. Each has unique weaponry and stats.
Defend from invasion of the opposite fraction, gain game progress, gold and upgrades!
